# Semester Project - Proposal (15% of the Semester Project Points)
### Due: October 3rd, 2018, 11:00pm

As discussed in the class, submit a 1-2 page proposal for the semester project.
While I have discussed ideas with most students, if you do not have an idea yet,
please discuss with the instructor soon.


Things to add in your proposal
-----------------------------

1. The proposal should discuss the project title and project member(s).

2. The first paragraph must provide an abstract of the problem you trying to
   solve, and its importance and relevance.

3. The second paragraph must briefly describe an approach to analyze the
   problem. This includes relevant papers, existing application or systems,
   open-source projects, or even Linux OS/tools you will be using to motivate
   the importance of the problem.

4. The third paragraph must briefly describe your deliverables at the end of the
   semester; this includes a possible solution to the problem, code demos, and a
   brief description of what evaluations you will use to evaluate your system.
